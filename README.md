## Rules

Each player can have either of these points in one game:
    0 ("Love")
    15 ("Fifteen")
    30 ("Thirty")
    40 ("Forty")
If you have 40 and you win the ball you win the game.
If both have 40 the score is "deuce".
If the game is in deuce, the winner of a ball will have advantage.
If the player with advantage wins the ball, the player wins the game
If the player without advantage wins they are back at deuce.
